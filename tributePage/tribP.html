            <h2>Ganyu</h2>
            <li>
              One of her first Genshin cosplays, it became her signature cosplay within the community with the umbrella
              as she often tries on different outfits and dresses that fits her style and personality.

            <h2>Keqing</h2>
            <li>
              Another cosplay often used on many outfits, Keqing is Ganyu's closest peers. Often used for
              more casual cosplays but also used by her boyfriend to cosplay as a lesbian couple, one of the popular
              ships in the fandom.

            <h2>
              Hu Tao
            </h2>
            <li>
              The crowd favorite halloween character, and short character. She captures the playful mischief of Hu Tao well,
              and rocks the casual version too like a Hu Tao pretending to be a Baguio student.

            <h2>Sucrose</h2>
            <li>
              Since she loves her boyfriend very much, she decided to buy a cosplay to match his signature cosplay, Albedo,
              to cosplay the popular ship "Alberose". Ever since, they are usually found cosplaying these together on their
              cosplay dates around Baguio.

            <h2>Fu Xuan</h2>
            <li>
              A rather spontaneous purchase, she bought this while Honkai Star Rail was still hot news. She quickly got
              comfortable with the character and went on to win in a Christmas cosplay competition event by
              the City of Baguio.
